ETHS 052: Black Women’s History

Spring 2018


This semester’s course builds the history of Black women, using both secondary sources (like Jacqueline Jones Royster’s Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow) and primary sources (like the poems of Phillis Wheatley and James McCune Smith’s “The Schoolmaster”). Of course, historians like Royster are only able to create their secondary works by drawing on a vast body of earlier primary sources.


The final project for this class asks you to use primary sources in the same way that Jacqueline Jones Royster uses them. Except that where Royster uses her sources to tell the story of all Black women, you will use primary sources to tell the story of either an individual Black woman or a Black women’s event. This project asks you to comb through the databases listed under the primary sources tab on this website to identify at least 20 documents that tell the story of this woman or event you have chosen.


Then, create interactive documentary history of the person or event on which your research is focused. Use one of the following free platforms:

* WordPress
* Tumblr
* Prezi

Your website should present the primary source documents you have identified, using either transcriptions, links, embedded audio and video, posted images (photos and/or illustrations, with proper attribution and links), or some combination of these elements. It should also include the following elements:

A one-paragraph biography of the person or event, highlighting their/its historical significant
A timeline of key events in the life of the subject (included at least 5 dates)
The presentation of your primary source documents (as described above)

Please be as creative as you can in  your presentation of the required information. I will provide links to examples of both faculty- and student-created sites that might serve as inspiration.
